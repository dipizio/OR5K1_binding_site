## OR5K1 models
- OR5K1 structural starting models obtained from homology modeling (HM_starting_model.pdb) and the AlphaFold2 database (AF2_starting_model.pdb) after protein preparation with compound 1.<br/>

- OR5K1 structural models obtained from homology modeling and AlphaFold2 after the first two stage of binding site refinement through induced-fit docking simulations (IDF1, IDF2) with compound 1 (OR5K1_IDF1_IDF2_models.zip).

- OR5K1 structural models obtained from homology modeling and AlphaFold2 after binding site refinement through induced-fit docking simulations with compound 1 (OR5K1_IFD3_models.zip).<br/>
In the table OR5K1_IFD3_models.csv , for each structure, we report AUC and EF15% values, as well as information about the clustering and predicted van der Waals (vdW, kcal/mol) contribution of L104 and L255 to the binding of compound 1.
