# OR5K1_binding_site

## Inactives Molecule data set
<br/>
The file INACTIVES_dataset_OR5K1.csv in csv format contains Names and SMILEs of each inactive compound used in this work.<br/>
<br/>

## Table S5. Best performing models of IFD3.
<br/>
Models with d < 0.4, AUC > 0.8 after IFD3. Structure indicate the name of the pdb file. We report AUC and EF15% values, as well as information about the clustering and predicted van der Waals (vdW, kcal/mol) contribution of L104 and L255 to the binding of compound 1.
<br/>

## Selected structured of the IFD3
<br/>
OR5K1_IFD3_models.zip contains all the structures (in pdb format) reported in Table S5 divided in two folders for AF2 and HM. Each pdb contains the OR5K1 refined models and the compound 1 (resname UNK, resid 900).<br/>
