## OR5K1 models
<br/>
OR5K1 structural models obtained from homology modeling and AlphaFold2 after binding site refinement through induced-fit docking simulations with compound 1 (OR5K1_IFD3_models.zip).<br/>
In the table OR5K1_selected_models.csv , for each structure, we report AUC and EF15% values, as well as information about the clustering and predicted van der Waals (vdW, kcal/mol) contribution of L104 and L255 to the binding of compound 1.
